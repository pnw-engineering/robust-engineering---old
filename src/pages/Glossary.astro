        <h1>Statistics Terms</h1>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Normality</div>
          <div class="text">The property that determines how well a set of data fits a normal distribution. Knowing this
            aids in selecting the best statistical tools for further analysis.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">P value</div>
          <div class="text">The probability that a null hypothesis has been satisfied and therefore cannot be rejected.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Model</div>
          <div class="text">A fabrication intended to predict output parameters based on input parameters. Used
            regularly in development as an analytical tool that can be used in lieu of physical testing.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Mean</div>
          <div class="text">The statistical property that describes the central tendancy of a data set (assumed to be
            normally distributed). Usually thought of as the " avarage".</div>
        </div>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Median</div>
          <div class="text">The statistical property that describes the central tendancy of a data set (assumed not to
            be normally distributed).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Standard deviation</div>
          <div class="text">The statistical property that describes the spread of a data set (assumed to be normally
            distributed). The simbol σ is used to designate standard deviation. Calculated as the square root of the
            variance. One nice property of σ is that the unit of measure for σ is the same as that of the data in the
            set and is therefor more intuitive.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Variance</div>
          <div class="text">The average of the squared difference from the mean of a data set. One nice property of
            variance is that they can be summed across data sets to determine vafriance for the sum of the sets.</div>
        </div>

        <h1>Reliability Terms</h1>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Stress/Strength relationship</div>
          <div class="text">A property that can be used to evaluate reliability based on product strengths (generally
            measured) against stresses applied in teh field (generally assumed).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Failure Mode</div>
          <div class="text">A way that a product or part can fail in the field. Quality escapes can be reduced by early
            identification and mitigation of failure modes.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="news-card glow-box">
          <div class="heading">Failure Site</div>
          <div class="text">The spicific design feature whare a known failure mode occurs in a product or part. These
            should be clearly identified and maintained in DFMEAs.</div>
