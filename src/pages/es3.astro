                    effects.
                    Statistical methods are available to understand the types and amount of variation that occurs. <span
                        class="highlight">Common Cause</span> variation is the variation naturally seen from the
                    processes being
                    used. <span class="highlight">Special Cause</span> variation is variation caused by some unusual
                    factor that
                    can generally be controlled and eliminated. <span class="highlight">Control Charts</span> are a
                    common tool
                    for keeping processes within their design limits.
